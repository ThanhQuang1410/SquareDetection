## Square Detection
## Installation
To avoid error from new React version, I suggest using ``yarn`` to install.
```bash
yarn install
```
## Input
You will have a day to create a simple iOS/Android application using React-Native. This app should do the following things:

The app should be able to take a video and save it locally
The app should be able to process the video to do something interesting. (e.g. detect a horizontal/ vertical line drawn on paper)
Once the application processes the video it should show a result/ output.

## Output
Live detect Square on frame and crop it into image when capture
